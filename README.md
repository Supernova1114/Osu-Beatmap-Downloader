#IMPORTANT#
*PREREQUISITES: Google Chrome, Java 8+

1. double-click Chromedriver and check if its version is SIMILAR to your Chrome Browser version.
Ex: Chromedriver: 80.0.3987.16, Chrome: 80.0.3987.106.
If you do not have a similar version (Ex: Chrome 81, Driver 80), download it at: https://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/index.html

*Note: Chromedriver must be in the same folder as the Osu Beatmap Downloader*
