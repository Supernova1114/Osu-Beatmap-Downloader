# Osu-Beatmap-Downloader
### Makes it possible to download Osu! beatmaps in bulk!


* *A little project that I challenged myself to make in order to learn more Java*

### Prerequisites: Google Chrome, Java 8+

* Open the application and click **Edit > Settings** in the menu bar and login to your Osu! account, change your download directory,
and restart the application.

**Due to an Osu! website captcha, if you enter your Osu! login incorrectly, you must:**
1. Correct your credentials in-app.
2. Uncheck "Headless".
3. Restart app.
4. Solve Captcha.
5. Check "Headless".
6. Restart app.

* **If things are not working, you may need to wait for an update.**

**Controls:**
* Alt+Click on a map to open its webpage.
* Click on a map to select it.
* Click Download to download selected maps.
* Shift-Click one map and then shift click another to select
all maps in between inclusive. Can be used to deselect maps as well.
